# Patternlab

This is a Ruby-based wrapper around [patternlab.io](http://patternlab.io/). It
is meant to make it easier to include the Pattern Lab within your Rails
projects.

Because Pattern Lab is PHP based, you are required to have PHP 5.3+ installed
on your system.

You are also able to use HAML for your patterns. All `.haml` files will be
rendered to Mustache files before the static site generation.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'patternlab', :github => 'tablexi/patternlab', :submodules => true

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install patternlab

## Usage

### Initialize

    $ rake patternlab:init

This will create a directory of source files in `/pattern-lab`. These are the
files you will edit to customize your design library. These files should
be committed to version control.

### Generate

    $ rake patternlab:generate

This generates the static site and places it into the public folder. The library
will be available at `/pattern-lab/` (currently, the trailing slash is
necessary. It is up to you if you want to commit these files to source control
or add them to .gitignore. If you want the library to be available on your
staging/production server, then you should commit them.
